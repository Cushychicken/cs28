Project: lastlogin 

Purpose: To show the last login from a user recorded in either the system 
	wtmp file, or a target wtmp file if supplied. 

Outline:
	The program reads a set number of utmp records from wtmp, searches 
	through the records for a username matching the one supplied as a 
	command line argument, and prints the utmp record to stdout if 
	found. Returns no output if none found for that username. 

Output:
	The output looks like:
        username, tty, datetime (Mon d HH:mm), host

Arguments:
	Required:
		* Username to search wtmp records for (command line)

	Optional:
		* "-f <fname>" : Alternate file target of wtmp 

Input:
	lastlogin only accepts command line arguments. It requires no 
	additional input at runtime. 

Example: 
	lastlogin username 

	lastlogin username -f wtmp.file

	lastlogin -f wtmp.file username

Data Structures:
        lastlogin utilizes a buffer defined in "utmplib.c" to access all
	wtmp records. All calls to the buffer are made by reference. 

Files:
        lastlogin reads a file of utmp records.  See Arguments and Input
        sections above.

Project: whodate 

Purpose: To show all user logins on a specified date. 

Outline:
	The program reads a set number of utmp records from wtmp, searches 
	through the records' epoch timestamps for a timestamp greater than 
	the epoch time of the day in question, and prints all records from 
	the epoch day. 

Output:
	The output looks like:
        username, tty, datetime (Mon d HH:mm), host

Arguments:
	Required:
		* Login Year 	 (YYYY format)
		* Login Month 	 (MM format)
		* Login Day	 (d/DD format)
		 

	Optional:
		* "-f <fname>" : Alternate file target of wtmp 
			(defaults to system wtmp file)

Input:
	whodate only accepts command line arguments. It requires no 
	additional input at runtime. 

Example: 
	whodate 2011 12 16

	whodate -f wtmp.file 2012 4 20

	whodate 2001 9 11 -f wtmp.file

Data Structures:
        whodate utilizes a buffer defined in "utmplib.c" to access all
	wtmp records. All calls to the buffer are made by reference. 

Files:
        whodate reads a file of utmp records.  See Arguments and Input
        sections above.
